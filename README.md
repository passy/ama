I'm neither as interesting as @sindresorhus nor as eloquent as @stephenplusplus,
but here we are. Ask away.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite. :)
